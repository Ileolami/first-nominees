Then on the \"survive or win\" we have Cube, Saw, Death race, Hunger games, Battle royale (already the most ripped off in Squid Game, As the gods will (also extremely ripped off in Squid Game).\r\nSo here the theme is the bleak today's world where a father can't keep a job and gain money for his family. So an invite comes for a game where you can gain big money. But soon contestants die. My interest died at this point. But to have an opinion, I watched it til the end. There was a big reveal, wow that was the best they could do? \r\nSo to be precise in the ripoffs. Battle Royale, teenagers are sent to an island and the sole survivor is freed. This is a GAME, there's rules, a duration, an objective. Same for SG, rules, objective, duration. As the gods will we have teenagers visited by a strange head sculpture that takes them hostage and makes them participate in various KIDS games where most will die. Does it describe Squid Game? Especially the \"kids\" games turned to horror adult death traps.\r\nThe directing and acting are average at best. I got fed upo with the father fast with his stunned face he does all the time.\r\nSome design of the games is OK, but also close to As the gods will.\r\nI put 1/10 for obvious steal of an already oversused idea (yeah Hunger Games was of the most horrible movies I've sen in my life).","created_at":"2024-12-26T15:31:33.447Z","id":"676d76d52c9097b266613f5c","updated_at":"2024-12-26T16:54:09.032Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/676d76d52c9097b266613f5c"},{"author":"MovieGuys","author_details":{"avatar_path":null,"name":"","rating":7,"username":"MovieGuys"},"content":"Whilst not an entirely original idea, \"Squid Game\" is done with enough inspiration, to warrant at least, a look. \r\n\r\nThat said, it took me quite some time to tune in. The idea didn't immediately appeal to me, as it did a lot of other viewers. I found the first season, creative, colourful and more than little disturbing. Of course, children's games combined with murder, was never going to be comfortable mix. \r\n\r\nI do believe season one is markedly better than the second go around. Season two offers more of the same, with less of the intrigue inherent in the first season. The introduction of blatant DEI content in season two, is something I could have well and truly done without, too.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I believe \"Squid Game\" is a one season hit. Having watched all of season one and most of season two, I see little to distinguish two from its predecessor.Give season one a go by all means but my personal belief is season two, adds little of value. I rate season one 7/10 and two 6/10.

It's super interesting. Not a single dull moment in this show. \r\n\r\nHowever, in season 2, seems like liberal fascists infiltrated in this show and meddled with this it. So, we got transgender character who identifies himself as a \"woman\"and goes to women restroom with the rest ladies. Others also refer to him as \"her\". I'm so tired from this crap. Man is man and woman is woman, period. No matter how many times you liberal fascists try to put your idiotism and dirty agenda into movies and shows, this fact will remain fact and you only enrage people more with your forced propaganda. This is why you lost in US elections and this is why you're going to lose more and more. Get used to it. You're a dying breed, leftists.\r\n\r\nI'll still give this show 10/10, because show itself is a real masterpiece. Probabaly creators were forced to put this crap agenda in season 2, because season 1 was clean from it. Hopefully after January 20th, when Trump enters the office, we will see less and less propaganda in shows and movies.

It may be masterpiece for those who have find death game genre through squid game, but the series death game personally didn't do much for me because I have expirenced the games and tension and political commentary from superior servings such as Kaiji and thousands of other death battle manga, Liar Game being the best .\r\n\r\nfirst two episode 10 and 9\r\nmiddle episode rating average 6\r\nFinal episode 5(unnecessarily extending the stale concept)\r\n\r\nOverall 6.1/10","created_at":"2024-01-09T16:27:14.395Z","id":"659d73e26d97e6014a94c59d","updated_at":"2024-01-09T16:30:08.109Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/659d73e26d97e6014a94c59d"},{"author":"TheTenth","author_details":{"avatar_path":null,"name":"","rating":null,"username":"TheTenth"},"content":"extremely disappointing idea theft\r\nSo once there was \"The most dangerous game\" (you see \"game\" in the title?) where shipwreckes survivors are hunted by Count Zaroff and if they survive they're free. Then on the \"survive or win\" we have Cube, Saw, Death race, Hunger games, Battle royale (already the most ripped off in Squid Game, As the gods will (also extremely ripped off in Squid Game).\r\nSo here the theme is the bleak today's world where a father can't keep a job and gain money for his family. So an invite comes for a game where you can gain big money. But soon contestants die. My interest died at this point. But to have an opinion, I watched it til the end. There was a big reveal, wow that was the best they could do? \r\nSo to be precise in the ripoffs. Battle Royale, teenagers are sent to an island and the sole survivor is freed. This is a GAME, there's rules, a duration, an objective. Same for SG, rules, objective, duration. As the gods will we have teenagers visited by a strange head sculpture that takes them hostage and makes them participate in various KIDS games where most will die. Does it describe Squid Game? Especially the \"kids\" games turned to horror adult death traps.\r\nThe directing and acting are average at best. I got fed upo with the father fast with his stunned face he does all the time.\r\nSome design of the games is OK, but also close to As the gods will.\r\nI put 1/10 for obvious steal of an already oversused idea (yeah Hunger Games was of the most horrible movies I've sen in my life).","created_at":"2024-12-26T15:31:33.447Z","id":"676d76d52c9097b266613f5c","updated_at":"2024-12-26T16:54:09.032Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/676d76d52c9097b266613f5c"},{"author":"MovieGuys","author_details":{"avatar_path":null,"name":"","rating":7,"username":"MovieGuys"},"content":"Whilst not an entirely original idea, \"Squid Game\" is done with enough inspiration, to warrant at least, a look. \r\n\r\nThat said, it took me quite some time to tune in. The idea didn't immediately appeal to me, as it did a lot of other viewers. I found the first season, creative, colourful and more than little disturbing. Of course, children's games combined with murder, was never going to be comfortable mix. \r\n\r\nI do believe season one is markedly better than the second go around. Season two offers more of the same, with less of the intrigue inherent in the first season. The introduction of blatant DEI content in season two, is something I could have well and truly done without, too.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I believe \"Squid Game\" is a one season hit. Having watched all of season one and most of season two, I see little to distinguish two from its predecessor.Give season one a go by all means but my personal belief is season two, adds little of value. I rate season one 7/10 and two 6/10.

It's super interesting. Not a single dull moment in this show. \r\n\r\nHowever, in season 2, seems like liberal fascists infiltrated in this show and meddled with this it. So, we got transgender character who identifies himself as a \"woman\"and goes to women restroom with the rest ladies. Others also refer to him as \"her\". I'm so tired from this crap. Man is man and woman is woman, period. No matter how many times you liberal fascists try to put your idiotism and dirty agenda into movies and shows, this fact will remain fact and you only enrage people more with your forced propaganda. This is why you lost in US elections and this is why you're going to lose more and more. Get used to it. You're a dying breed, leftists.\r\n\r\nI'll still give this show 10/10, because show itself is a real masterpiece. Probabaly creators were forced to put this crap agenda in season 2, because season 1 was clean from it. Hopefully after January 20th, when Trump enters the office, we will see less and less propaganda in shows and movies. World is slowly waking up.","created_at":"2025-01-03T07:02:24.176Z","id":"67778b80b55ff939be668ac1","updated_at":"2025-01-04T18:21:53.915Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/67778b80b55ff939be668ac1"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":6}}}}}}}}
